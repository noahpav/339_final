For thousands of years, Indigenous peoples, including the Ojibwe, utilized the island for fishing, hunting, and copper mining. Evidence of ancient mining pits and tools dating back over 4,500 years reveals the island's role as a key site for early copper extraction.",
        "In the 19th and early 20th centuries, European settlers and industries arrived, establishing fishing villages, logging camps, and small mining operations. However, the island's rugged terrain and isolation made large-scale development challenging. By the mid-20th century, preservationists advocated for its protection, valuing its pristine ecosystems and wilderness.",
        "In 1931, Isle Royale was designated as a national park, and in 1980, it became a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, recognized for its unique ecosystem, including the delicate predator-prey relationship between wolves and moose. Today, the park preserves its natural beauty and cultural history, inviting visitors to explore a landscape shaped by both human ingenuity and the forces of nature."

In the mid-19th century, industrial copper mining took off, drawing immigrants from Finland, Italy, Ireland, and other nations to work in the mines and build vibrant communities.",
        "By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Keweenaw Peninsula was one of the most important copper-producing regions in the world, fueling industrial growth in the United States.
