          Michigan's national parks showcase the rich history and breathtaking
          natural beauty of the Great Lakes State. The legacy began with Isle
          Royale National Park, designated in 1940, which is renowned for its
          rugged wilderness, pristine waters, and fascinating wolf-moose
          predator-prey study. Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore followed in
          1966, becoming the first officially designated national lakeshore in
          the United States, celebrated for its colorful cliffs, sandstone
          formations, and serene waterfalls.

          Beyond these landmarks, each park offers something unique. Sleeping
          Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, with its towering dunes and sweeping
          views of Lake Michigan, was named the "Most Beautiful Place in
          America" by Good Morning America in 2011. Keweenaw National Historical
          Park preserves the stories of Michigan's copper mining boom, while the
          River Raisin National Battlefield Park honors the War of 1812 and the
          struggle for freedom. Finally, the North Country Trail spans over
          4,800 miles across multiple states, offering hikers a chance to
          explore the diverse landscapes of Michigan and beyond.
