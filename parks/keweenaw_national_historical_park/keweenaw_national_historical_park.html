        <h2>Some History</h2>
        
        <p>The Keweenaw Peninsula has been home to copper mining for over 7,000 years. Native American communities were the first to extract copper from the region, using it to create tools and trade goods. In the mid-19th century, industrial copper mining took off, drawing immigrants from Finland, Italy, Ireland, and other nations to work in the mines and build vibrant communities.</p>
        
        <p>By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Keweenaw Peninsula was one of the most important copper-producing regions in the world, fueling industrial growth in the United States. However, as copper reserves dwindled, mining operations ceased by the mid-20th century. Today, the park preserves this legacy, sharing stories of innovation, resilience, and cultural heritage.</p>
        
        <p>Established in 1992, Keweenaw National Historical Park encompasses numerous historic sites and partner organizations that together tell the story of life and work in Michigan’s Copper Country.</p>
