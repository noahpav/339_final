        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>
          The Battle of the River Raisin, fought in January 1813, was one of the
          largest engagements of the War of 1812. American forces clashed with
          British troops and their Native American allies in a fight for control
          of southeastern Michigan. After initial success, American forces
          suffered a devastating defeat on January 22, 1813, with many killed,
          wounded, or taken captive. The aftermath saw atrocities committed
          against wounded soldiers, fueling the rallying cry, “Remember the
          Raisin,” which motivated American forces in subsequent battles.

        <p>
          The site of the battlefield was neglected for much of the 19th and
          20th centuries. Efforts to preserve the area began in the 1990s, and
          in 2010, it was designated as a national battlefield park, ensuring
          the story of the battle and its significance would be remembered for
          future
