        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Isle Royale National Park has a rich history shaped by both nature and
          human activity. For thousands of years, Indigenous peoples, including
          the Ojibwe, utilized the island for fishing, hunting, and copper
          mining. Evidence of ancient mining pits and tools dating back over
          4,500 years reveals the island's role as a key site for early copper
          extraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 19th and early 20th centuries, European settlers and industries
          arrived, establishing fishing villages, logging camps, and small
          mining operations. However, the island's rugged terrain and isolation
          made large-scale development challenging. By the mid-20th century,
          preservationists advocated for its protection, valuing its pristine
          ecosystems and wilderness.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1931, Isle Royale was designated as a national park, and in 1980,
          it became a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, recognized for its unique
          ecosystem, including the delicate predator-prey relationship between
          wolves and moose. Today, the park preserves its natural beauty and
          cultural history, inviting visitors to explore a landscape shaped by
          both human ingenuity and the forces of nature.
