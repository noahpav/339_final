        <h2>Some History</h2>
        
        <p>Pictured Rocks has long been a place of cultural and natural significance. The cliffs were named for their vivid colors and unique patterns, caused by mineral stains of iron, manganese, and copper. For centuries, the area was home to Native American tribes, particularly the Ojibwe, who lived off the land and used the waterways for travel and trade.</p>
        
        <p>In the 19th century, the region became an important site for logging and shipping, as its location on Lake Superior made it a hub for transporting lumber and other goods. Recognizing its unique beauty and ecological importance, Pictured Rocks was designated as the United States’ first national lakeshore in 1966. Today, it is celebrated for its rich history, scenic landscapes, and outdoor recreation opportunities.</p>
