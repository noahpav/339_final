        <h2>Some History</h2>
        
        <p>Designated as a National Scenic Trail in 1980, the North Country Trail was established to promote outdoor recreation and preserve America’s natural and cultural heritage. Michigan plays a crucial role in the trail’s journey, hosting the longest segment within any single state.
