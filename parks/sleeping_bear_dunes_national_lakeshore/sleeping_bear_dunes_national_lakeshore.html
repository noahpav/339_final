        <h2>Some History</h2>
        
        <p>Sleeping Bear Dunes gets its name from an ancient Ojibwe legend about a mother bear and her cubs. According to the story, a mother bear and her two cubs tried to swim across Lake Michigan to escape a forest fire. The cubs drowned, forming the Manitou Islands, while the mother bear rested on the shore, becoming the dunes.</p>
        
        <p>The area has long been home to Indigenous peoples who relied on its abundant natural resources. European settlers arrived in the 19th century, establishing farming communities, logging camps, and shipping routes. By the mid-20th century, conservationists sought to protect the area’s unique dunes and ecosystems. In 1970, Sleeping Bear Dunes was designated a national lakeshore, preserving its natural and cultural heritage for future generations.</p>
