        <h2>Some History</h2>
        
        <p>Isle Royale National Park has a rich history shaped by both nature and human activity...</p>
        
        <p>In the 19th and early 20th centuries, European settlers and industries arrived, establishing fishing villages, logging camps, and small mining operations. However, the island's rugged terrain and isolation made large-scale development challenging. By the mid-20th century, preservationists advocated for its protection, valuing its pristine ecosystems and wilderness.</p>
        
        <p>In 1931, Isle Royale was designated as a national park, and in 1980, it became a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, recognized for its unique ecosystem, including the delicate predator-prey relationship between wolves and moose. Today, the park preserves its natural beauty and cultural history, inviting visitors to explore a landscape shaped by both human ingenuity and the forces of nature.</p>
